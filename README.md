# Steal the Show
Steal the Show is an e-commerce app and solution to finding your complete latest outfit: dresses, shoes, and handbags, without having to pay the huge retail price. Women don't like to wear the same dress twice for special occasions, so renting is the obvious choice! Log in to save your choices to your profile and then either rent or purchase those items. Log back in to see your profile and click to return your items.
